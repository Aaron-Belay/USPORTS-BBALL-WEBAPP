# USPORTS BASKETBALL WEB APP (IN PROGRESS)

This is a personal project for me, a computer science student. This website is my platform for sharing analytics and insights into the Canadian university basketball league, or U Sports. I am passionate about basketball and data analysis, and this project allows me to combine the two.

## Goal

I aim to provide basketball enthusiasts, coaches, players, and fans with valuable data-driven insights and analytics to help them better understand and enjoy U Sports basketball. I aim to promote the sport and contribute to its growth in Canadian universities through this project.

## Project Structure

The USPORTS BASKETBALL WEB APP project is organized into three main folders:

1. **data_pipeline**: This folder contains scripts and functions for handling web scraping and updating the database with the latest data from USports website.

2. **database**: Here, you'll find the SQLite database file where all the data for the web application is stored.

3. **usport_flask_app**: This folder contains the Flask application code. It includes the routes, models, and other files necessary for running the web application.
