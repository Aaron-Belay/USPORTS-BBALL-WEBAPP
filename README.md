# USPORTS BASKETBALL WEB APP (IN PROGRESS)

This is a personal project for me, a computer science student. This website serves as my platform for sharing analytics and insights into the Canadian university basketball league, also known as U Sports. I am passionate about basketball and data analysis, and this project allows me to combine the two.

## Goal

My mission is to provide basketball enthusiasts, coaches, players, and fans with valuable data-driven insights and analytics to help them better understand and enjoy U Sports basketball. Through this project, I hope to promote the sport and contribute to the growth of basketball in Canadian universities.
