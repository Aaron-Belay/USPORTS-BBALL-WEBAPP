# USPORTS BASKETBALL WEB APP

This is a personal project by me (OJ), a computer science student. This website serves as my platform to share analytics and insights into the Canadian university basketball league, commonly known as U Sports. I'm passionate about basketball and data analysis, and this project allows me to combine both interests.

## Goal

My mission is to provide basketball enthusiasts, coaches, players, and fans with valuable data-driven insights and analytics to enhance their understanding and enjoyment of U Sports basketball. Through this project, I aim to promote the sport and contribute to the growth of basketball in Canadian universities.

## What I Offer

At U Sports Basketball Statistics, you'll find a wide range of statistical metrics and analyses, including team performance, player statistics, team standings and much more. My platform allows you to delve deep into the numbers, enabling informed decision-making and enhancing your basketball experience.
